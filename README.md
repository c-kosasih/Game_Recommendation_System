# 🎮 Game Recommendation System
A content-based recommender system that helps users discover new video games based on their interests.

🧩 Features Used:
- Developer
- Rating
- Platform
- Genre
- Publisher

These features are combined into a custom 🍲 "soup feature", a text blend of all key attributes.

## 🔧 How It Works:
The soup is processed using 🧠 TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into vectors. The system then calculates game similarity 🔍 and recommends titles based on content relevance 🤝.
